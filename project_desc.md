# Project Description

## 1. Project Title
**Project Name**: Data Visualization Tool

## 2. Project Overview
The Data Visualization Tool is a desktop application designed for loading, processing, and visualizing data from Excel files. It allows users to select columns from a dataset, specify which column should be used for the X-axis and Y-axis in a plot, and generate graphical representations of the data. This tool is intended to simplify data analysis by providing an intuitive interface for visualizing relationships between different columns of data.

## 3. Background
Data visualization is crucial for analyzing and understanding complex datasets. Traditional data analysis methods can be cumbersome and require specialized knowledge. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing data trends and relationships, making data analysis accessible to users with varying levels of expertise.

## 4. Objectives
- Objective 1: Enable users to load Excel files and process the data.
- Objective 2: Provide functionality to select and manage columns for visualization.
- Objective 3: Generate plots based on user-selected columns with customizable axis labels.

## 5. Scope
The project includes the following functionalities:
- Loading Excel files and processing the data.
- Displaying column names in a list for user selection.
- Allowing users to add, remove, and clear columns for visualization.
- Generating plots with customizable axis labels.

The project does not include advanced data processing or analysis features beyond basic plotting and visualization.
